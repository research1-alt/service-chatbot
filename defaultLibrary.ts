# TECHNICAL MANUAL: MATEL POWER TRAIN (12V)

## 1. Operational Procedures & Notes

### Power Flow System
1. **Aux Battery to FAB** (Fuse Box Input).
2. **FAB (Fuse Box Output)** to Emergency Switch input.
3. **Emergency Switch Output** to Ignition Switch Input.
4. **Ignition Switch Output** pin no 2 to MCU Relay at Pin no 30.

### Vehicle Start Sequence
- **Vehicle On Sequence:** 12V From aux Battery to FAB(Fuse Box Aux Battery INput), FAB (Output) to Emergency Switch input , Emergency Switch Output to Ignition Switch Input. Ignition Switch Have 2 Step for Power Distribution.
- **Step 1 (Key Turn):** Main 48V Battery turns ON. Cluster ON(Depend Upon Aux Battery).
- **Step 2 (Key Turn):** MCU turns ON. DC-output Relay On, Regen Relay got 12V, BFNR Switch got 12V(Depend Upon Aux Battery).
- ** So in both Condition if any function is depend on Aux Battery (12V) and not getting on First Check the Aux Battery Voltage After that another things.
- **About Cluster:** If we are Sloki Cluster, Sloki CLuster getting on if Aux Battery Volage Between 11V-14.3V, If Aux Battery Voltage is less or above than given range cluster will not getting on.
- ** Sloki Cluster also give to Digital output (Ground) once Cluster getting on. 1st Ground - 1second after cluster get power . 2nd Ground - After 3 Second of Cluster get Power.
- **Virya Cluster:- If we are using Virya cluster instead of Sloki, there is no delay option in cluster also all the relay which is operated through Delay will be operated by Common ground so when we are using sloki cluster we are getting delays and respected relays will be operated by delay but if we are using virya cluster we need to give ground to respected relay.
- ** If we are using Virya Cluster instead of Sloki Cluster in Matel Vehicle, there is 1 more coupler named VC. This Coupler include Ground at both Pin. so just connect this coupler with Delay coupler.
**Important Note on Odometer Saving:**
This sequence is critical for saving the odometer reading correctly. 
- **Startup:** Main Battery must turn on in Step 1, then MCU in Step 2.
- **Shutdown:** First MCU must turn off, then the Main Battery.
If this sequence fails, the odometer reading will not be saved. Check the Main Battery and MCU Relay sequence if issues persist.

### MCU Working Condition
1. MCU must receive **12V from the MCU Relay**.
2. **BFGNR Switch** must receive 12V from the Ignition Switch.
3. Put the vehicle in any mode (Forward, Boost, Gradient, or Reverse).
4. Once the mode appears in the Cluster, apply throttle gradually.
5. If the vehicle does not move, re-check the previous points.

### MCU Working Sequence
1- MCU get 48V 
2- MCU get 12V Ignition
3- After Working above both Condition BFGNR Switch get 12V. 
4- Throttle, Brake Pot and Encoder get 5V Supply From MCU.

## 2. Troubleshooting: Vehicle Not Moving

1. **Check MCU Ignition:** Ensure it is ON.
   - If MCU is OFF, check if the MCU Relay is receiving power.
   - Check **12V at Pin 30**. If present, check **Pin 87a**.
   - If Pin 30 has no supply, check previous connections.
   - If Pin 30 has supply but Pin 87a does not:
     - Check the relay coil using a multimeter for supply between **Pin 86 & 85**.
     - If supply is present, check if the charger is connected or if an "Immobilize" command was given.
     - Remove charger or clear the immobilize command if necessary.

2. **Check MCU Fuse Box (FMCU):**
   - Check if both points of the fuse box have supply.
   - If the fuse is blown, replace it.
   - If both points have supply but MCU is still OFF, check continuity between the **Fuse Box output** and **MCU Pin 1 & 10**.
   - Replace wiring harness if continuity is missing.

3. **Check BFGNR Switch:**
   - Must have **12V from Ignition Switch Pin 2**.
   - If Pin 2 has 12V but BFGNR switch does not, check continuity between these points.
   - If continuity is missing, replace wiring or use a jumper from Ignition Switch Pin 2 to BFGNR Pin 1.

4. **Check Error Codes:** Check the Cluster for any visible error codes and follow specific resolution steps for that code.
